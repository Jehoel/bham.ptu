This is a rudimentary DP PTU controller library written in C++/Qt based around a similar design to Bham.Ptu
	(that is, with the PTUnit and PTConnection classes).

It also makes use of SDL for joystick support. It requires Qt 4.6 and the QSerialDevice library.
	You can get SDL from http://www.libsdl.org
	You can get Qt from http://qt.nokia.com
	You can get QSerialDevice from http://qt-apps.org/content/show.php/QSerialDevice?content=112039

This library is licensed under the GPLv2, as is the QSerialDevice library which it links to.
